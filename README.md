# Studyspaces

Tracks study space openings through the use of motiontracking sensors connected under the tables and desks. Through tracking of black and white images, 
Studyspaces can effectively determine if a study space is open without infringing on user privacy or convenience. The data is connected through webpages 
for students to determine which spaces are open, what areas are most popular, and what times study spaces will be free. Management of these spaces can also utilize our data
to better optimize their spacing arrangement and create a significantly more efficient search strategy for students in times of need.
